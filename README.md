# SubsetSumProblem
C code for 3 different architectures i.e. GPU/Cray XMT/OMP  to demonstrate parallelizing Subset Sum Problem.

This is code from my Master's thesis work at Ohio State.

Thesis: “Parallel Solution of the Subset-sum Problem: An Empirical Study,” 
https://etd.ohiolink.edu/ap/10?0::NO:10:P10_ETD_SUBID:74185 (2011). 

Parallelization was evaluated on -
(1) 128- processor Cray XMT massively multithreaded supercomputer,
(2) 16-processor IBM x3755 shared memory machine and 
(3) 240-core NVIDIA FX 5800 GPU, for different ranges of problem sizes.
